# Smart-Loan-Predictor
This repository contains a Loan Prediction System built using Django and scikit-learn. The project predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as age, gender, education, income, employment experience, home ownership, credit history, loan amount, and past default records.
